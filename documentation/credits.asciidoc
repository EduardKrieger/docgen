`devonfw-docgen` tool is technically based on the following tools:

* http://maven.apache.org[maven]
* http://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor]
** via http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-maven-plugin[asciidoctor-maven-plugin]
* http://ant.apache.org[ant]
** via http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-antrun-plugin[maven-antrun-plugin]

This setup was inspired by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-docs/[spring-boot-docs] and improved for link processing, ease of use, etc.
Feel free to get inspired here or copy the entire solution if you like it.
Thanks to all authors of the actual tools and to spring-boot for making this great `devonfw-docgen` possible.
